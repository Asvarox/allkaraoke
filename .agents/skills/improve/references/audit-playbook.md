# Audit Playbook

What to look for, per category. Each subagent (or direct audit pass) gets the relevant section plus the **Finding format** at the bottom. Adapt depth to repo size — a 2K-line CLI gets a lighter pass than a 500K-line monorepo.

A finding is only a finding with evidence. "Probably has N+1 queries somewhere" is not a finding; `orders/api.ts:142 issues one query per order item inside a loop` is.

---

## 1. Correctness / Bugs

The highest-trust category — real bugs found by reading, not speculation.

- Error handling: swallowed exceptions, empty catch blocks, `catch (e) { console.log(e) }` on critical paths, missing error states in UI code.
- Async hazards: unawaited promises, race conditions on shared state, missing cancellation/cleanup (stale closures in React effects, listeners never removed).
- Null/undefined flows: non-null assertions (`!`) on values that can be null, optional chaining hiding a value that must exist, unchecked array indexing.
- Boundary conditions: off-by-one, empty-collection handling, timezone/locale assumptions, integer overflow in counters/IDs.
- State machines: impossible-state combinations representable in types, status enums with unhandled branches (look for `default:` that silently no-ops).
- Concurrency: check-then-act on shared resources, missing transactions around multi-write operations, idempotency of retried operations (webhooks, queues).
- Type escape hatches: `any` / `as` casts / `@ts-ignore` clusters — each one is a place the compiler was overruled.
- Resource leaks: unclosed handles, connections, subscriptions; missing `finally`.

## 2. Security

Report only what's evidenced in the code. Do not generate exploit code in plans — describe the fix.

**Handling rule:** never copy a secret value into a finding or plan — those files get committed. Reference the `file:line` and credential type only ("Stripe live key at `config.ts:12`"), and the fix sketch always includes rotation, not just removal (a committed secret is burned even after deletion).

**By-design is not a finding:** standard platform conventions are intentional behavior — honoring `https_proxy`/`NO_PROXY`, reading `~/.netrc`, an explicitly local dev tool shelling out to configured package managers. Flag these only when the *implementation* adds risk beyond the convention itself.

- Secrets: hardcoded keys/tokens/passwords, secrets in committed `.env` files, secrets logged or persisted in event/history stores.
- Injection: string-built SQL/shell commands, `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` / `innerHTML` with user data, `eval`/`Function` on dynamic input, path traversal on user-supplied filenames.
- AuthN/Z: endpoints/server actions missing auth checks, authorization checked client-side only, IDOR (object access by ID without ownership check), missing CSRF protection on state-changing routes.
- Input validation: API boundaries trusting request bodies (no schema validation), file-upload handling (type/size/path), mass assignment from request objects.
- Dependencies: run the ecosystem's audit command (`npm audit`, `pip-audit`, `cargo audit`) in read-only mode; flag critical/high with known exploits, not the noise floor.
- Headers/config: CORS wildcard with credentials, missing CSP where it matters, cookies without `HttpOnly`/`Secure`/`SameSite`, debug/verbose modes reachable in production config.
- Data exposure: PII in logs, stack traces returned to clients, internal error details in API responses.

## 3. Performance

Look for the algorithmic and architectural wins, not micro-optimizations.

- N+1 patterns: query/fetch per item inside loops or per list-row rendering; missing batching or dataloader.
- Wrong complexity: nested scans over the same collection, repeated `find`/`filter` inside hot loops where a Map keyed lookup belongs.
- Caching gaps: identical expensive computations or fetches repeated per request/render; missing memoization at clear function boundaries; no HTTP/data-layer caching on stable data.
- Payload size: over-fetching (select *, full objects where IDs suffice), missing pagination on unbounded lists, large JSON shipped to clients.
- Frontend (if applicable): bundle composition (heavyweight deps for trivial use), missing code-splitting on rarely-hit routes, unoptimized images/fonts, client-side fetching for data available at render time, render waterfalls. For React/Next.js, defer to the repo's framework conventions and any installed best-practices guidelines.
- Backend: synchronous work that belongs in a queue, missing indexes implied by query patterns (flag for verification — don't claim without schema evidence), connection-per-request patterns where pooling exists.
- Build/CI: slow CI from missing caching, redundant pipeline steps, test suites that could parallelize.

## 4. Test Coverage

The goal is not a percentage — it's *which untested code is dangerous*.

- Map the critical paths (money, auth, data mutation, the feature the repo exists for) and check which have zero or trivial coverage.
- Modules with high churn (git log) + no tests = top refactor risk; flag as "characterization tests first" candidates.
- Existing test quality: tests that assert nothing meaningful, heavy mocking that tests the mocks, snapshot tests nobody reads, flaky patterns (real timers, real network, order dependence).
- Missing test layers: unit-only suites with zero integration coverage on API boundaries, or the inverse (slow E2E for what a unit test would catch).
- Verification infrastructure: is there a one-command way to know the codebase works? If not, that's finding #1 and a prerequisite plan for any risky change.

## 5. Tech Debt & Architecture

- Duplication: the same logic re-implemented in 3+ places (search for near-identical functions/components); divergent copies that have drifted.
- Layering violations: UI importing from data layer internals, circular dependencies, "utils" modules that became a junk drawer with high fan-in.
- Dead code: unexported-and-unused modules, feature flags fully rolled out but still branching, commented-out blocks with no explanation, deps in the manifest no longer imported.
- God objects/modules: files an order of magnitude larger than the repo median that everything touches; functions with double-digit parameters or deep conditional nesting.
- Inconsistent patterns: three ways of doing data fetching / error handling / styling in the same repo — pick the winner (the one the team converged on most recently) and plan the consolidation.
- Abstraction mismatches: premature abstractions with a single implementation, or missing abstractions where the same change always requires touching N files in lockstep.

## 6. Dependencies & Migrations

- Major-version lag on core framework/runtime (not every minor bump — the ones with real cost to staying behind: EOL, security-fix cutoffs, ecosystem incompatibility).
- Deprecated APIs in use that have announced removal timelines.
- Abandoned dependencies (no release in years, archived repos) on critical paths.
- Duplicate dependencies solving the same problem (two date libs, two HTTP clients).
- Lockfile/manifest drift, version pinning inconsistencies across a monorepo.
- For each migration candidate, estimate blast radius (files touched) — that drives effort and whether to recommend it at all.

## 7. DX & Tooling

- Missing or broken: typecheck script, lint config, formatter, pre-commit hooks, editorconfig.
- Slow feedback loops: dev-server or test startup measured in minutes, no watch mode, CI without caching.
- Onboarding friction: README setup steps that are wrong/incomplete, undocumented required env vars, no `.env.example`.
- Missing `CLAUDE.md`/`AGENTS.md` — for repos where agents will execute the plans, this is high-leverage: recommend one and include its outline as a plan.
- Error messages/logging: unstructured logs on services, missing request IDs/correlation, debugging requiring code changes.

## 8. Docs

Lowest default priority — only flag where absence has a concrete cost:

- Public API surface (published packages) without reference docs.
- Architectural decisions nobody can reconstruct (why X over Y) for actively-contested areas.
- Stale docs that are actively wrong (worse than missing) — setup instructions, API examples that no longer compile.

## 9. Direction — features & where to take this next

Forward-looking: not what's broken, but what this codebase wants to become. **Grounding rule:** every suggestion must cite evidence from the repo itself — a suggestion that could apply to any project in the category ("add dark mode", "add AI") is noise, not a finding. Sources of grounded direction signal:

- **Unfinished intent**: TODO/FIXME clusters around one theme, feature flags never rolled out, stubbed or half-built modules, commented-out feature code, abandoned mid-feature work visible in git history.
- **Stated-but-undelivered**: README/docs/roadmap promises with no corresponding code, CLI flags or config options that are no-ops, issue templates for features that don't exist.
- **Surface asymmetries**: one-directional pairs (export without import, create without bulk-create, webhooks out but not in), entities with CRUD minus one, a public API that internal code clearly needed and hand-rolled around.
- **The adjacent possible**: capabilities the existing architecture makes disproportionately cheap — a plugin system one interface away, a public API one route file from the existing service layer, an integration the data model already supports.
- **Friction worth productizing**: things users of this project evidently do by hand around it (visible in docs, examples, issues) that the project could absorb.

Direction findings use the standard format with two adaptations: **Impact** is product/user value (who wants this and why now), and **Confidence** reflects how grounded the evidence is — not certainty that it's the right call. Strategy belongs to the maintainer; the advisor's job is grounded options with honest trade-offs. Effort estimates here are coarser; say so. Plans for selected direction findings are usually a *design/spike plan* (investigate, prototype, define the API, list open questions) rather than a build-everything plan — scope them that way.

## Finding format

Every finding, from every category and every subagent, comes back in this shape:

```markdown
### [CATEGORY-NN] Short imperative title

- **Evidence**: `path/file.ts:123` — one-sentence description of what's there. (Repeat per location; 2–5 strongest locations, note "and ~N similar sites" if widespread.)
- **Impact**: What goes wrong / what's being paid because of this. Concrete: "every order-list render issues 1+N queries", not "suboptimal".
- **Effort**: S (hours) / M (a day-ish) / L (multi-day) — for the *fix*, including tests.
- **Risk**: What the fix could break; LOW/MED/HIGH plus one line why.
- **Confidence**: HIGH (read the code, certain) / MED (strong signal, needs verification) / LOW (smell, needs investigation). LOW-confidence findings may be reported but get an "investigate" plan, not a "fix" plan.
- **Fix sketch**: 1–3 sentences. Not the plan — just enough to judge effort honestly.
```

## Prioritization rubric

Order findings by **leverage = impact ÷ effort, discounted by confidence and fix-risk**. Tiebreakers:

1. Anything that unblocks other findings (verification baseline, characterization tests) floats up.
2. Security findings with HIGH confidence float above equivalent-leverage non-security findings.
3. Prefer findings whose fix has a clean verification story — executor models succeed at those.
4. "Not worth doing" is a valid verdict; record it with one line of reasoning so the user knows it was considered.
